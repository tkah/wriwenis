Wriwenis
=======
A chatbot I created for my Intro to AI course as my attempt to pass the Turing test. It uses Angular on the front-end and a Flask API that should be ready to deploy to Heroku. The idea is that you're speaking to a cult member of "Our Eternal Wriwenis" who gradually collects information about you in an attempt to get you to join his/her cult. It also uses some Markov Chains derived from a text comprised of the Ramayana, quotes from the Dalai Lama, Buddhist teachings, Rumi poetry, Psalms, Shakespeare sonnets and more. It is my first Flask application and, while it did manage to win our internal class contest, there are still some flaws.

Markov generated sentences are tweeted to the [@wriwenis](https://twitter.com/wriwenis) Twitter account.

Getting started section and demo site coming soon.
